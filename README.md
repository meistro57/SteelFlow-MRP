**SteelFlow MRP** is a next-generation Manufacturing Resource Planning system precision-engineered for the steel fabrication industry. It bridges the gap between complex engineering data and shop-floor execution.

---

## 🌟 Vision
To replace obsolete legacy systems with a high-performance, web-native platform that centralizes estimating, production, and logistics into a single source of truth.

## 📊 Current Status

**Development Stage:** Foundation Complete, Feature Implementation In Progress

SteelFlow MRP has a **solid foundation** with complete database architecture (14 migrations, 29 models) and comprehensive backend services. The project is currently in **active development** with focus on building out the user interface and controllers to connect the backend logic to the frontend.

- ✅ **Infrastructure:** Docker environment, authentication, database schema
- ✅ **Backend Services:** Import parsers, nesting engines, inventory management, reporting
- 🔄 **Controllers & UI:** Partially implemented - core modules need frontend interfaces
- 📅 **Estimating Module:** Planned for Phase 8

See the [Roadmap & Progress](#️-roadmap--progress) section below for detailed status.

## 🛠️ The SteelFlow Stack

### **Backend Core**
- **Framework**: Laravel 11 (PHP 8.4+)
- **Database**: MySQL 8.0
- **Cache/Queue**: Redis + Laravel Horizon
- **Search Engine**: Meilisearch (for sub-millisecond lookups)

### **Frontend Experience**
- **Framework**: Vue.js 3 + Inertia.js (The "Classic Monolith" feel with SPA speed)
- **State Management**: Pinia
- **UI Architecture**: Tailwind CSS + Headless UI

---

## ✨ Enterprise Features

- **📦 BOM Management**: High-fidelity tracking of piece marks, assemblies, and detailed part lists.
- **🔌 CAD Integration**: Native parsers for **KISS** and **XSR** formats.
- **📐 Material Optimization**: 1D (Linear) and 2D (Plate) nesting engines to minimize waste.
- **🛒 Smart Purchasing**: PO lifecycle tracking with integrated Heat Number and Mill Cert management.
- **⚡ Shop Floor Tracking**: Real-time progress updates via mobile-first barcode/QR scanning.
- **🚚 Logistics Control**: Automated load building, BOL generation, and shipping history.
- **🌍 Global Ready**: Seamless switching between Metric and Imperial systems at the core logic level.
